A post on the Nelspruit Concerned Citizens (NCC) Facebook page earned itself over 100 shares as community members’ concern for the safety of some lost young people spread. It turns out, however, that the youngsters in question had in fact reached safety even before the post had been made.

The request came in at about 20:30 on January 14. “People in Columbus and Suiderkruis streets heard children in distress in the vicinity of Steiltes Nature Reserve,” the post read. A thorough search of the reserve that yielded no results (as unbeknownst to them, there was no one to be found anymore) was called off at about 22:00, but the members remained on standby.

It was later confirmed by a member of the community that it was not calls of distress that the residents had heard from the reserve. The children were on a phone call with their friends who were trying to determine their position. The friends had instructed them to yell out in order for them to pinpoint their location.

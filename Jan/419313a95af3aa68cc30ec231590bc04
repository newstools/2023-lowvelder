A Fidelity security guard was shot dead and two of his colleagues sustained injuries during a cash-in-transit heist directly opposite the Hazyview Sun Hotel on the R40 at approximately 10:00 on Wednesday January 25.  According to Emer-G-Med’s Martin Jeffrey, they received an emergency call at 10:25 and dispatched two vehicles to the scene. Upon arrival, paramedics learned that the suspects had been driving a white Mercedes-Benz sedan that they used to ram the Fidelity vehicle and a backup security vehicle. The suspects then allegedly bombed the Fidelity vehicle and a shootout between the guards and the suspects ensued. One guard was assaulted and the other injured by the explosion while he attempted to flee the scene. Unfortunately, one of the backup guards sustained a fatal gunshot wound during the cross-fire and was declared dead on the scene by paramedics.

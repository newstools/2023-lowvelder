They did not exit the park until July 1 when rangers heard gunshots in the Malelane Section and started searching for the suspects using a helicopter. The rangers found another two dead white rhinos, continued with the search and found Makamu, Miyanga and Burro hiding and in possession of six fresh rhino horns, firearms, two hunting knives and four live rounds of ammunition. They were arrested. In court, the trio pleaded guilty and state prosecutor, Lot Mgiba, led evidence of DNA-positive results linking the suspects to the carcasses of a black rhino that was killed on June 30, 2022. A ballistic report confirming that the rhino horns that were found in their possession were of the two white rhinos, was presented as well.

Four tourists en route to a lodge near Numbi Gate were stopped by three armed suspects who shot the driver on October 3 2023. The suspects are said to have instructed the tourists to open the doors of their vehicle, but when the driver locked all the doors, one of the suspects apparently shot him through the window. The wounded driver still managed to speed off in reverse for about 100m before crashing into a wall. He was certified dead on the scene soon afterwards.

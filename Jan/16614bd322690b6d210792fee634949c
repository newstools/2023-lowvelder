At around 07:30 on January 14 a security guard exited Builders Warehouse Nelspruit, with money bags. Four armed suspects were waiting for him outside. According to an anonymous source, two of the suspects approached the guard as he was nearing the cash-in-transit vehicle. The other two suspects were keeping an eye on the driver of the vehicle. Once the first two suspects took the money bags off the guard, the other two proceeded to open fire on the vehicle. No one was injured.

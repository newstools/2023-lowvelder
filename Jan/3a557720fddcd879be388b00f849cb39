Traffic is currently moving on the R40 between Bushbuckridge and Acornhoek with only a few obstacles due to debris on the road.
The road was closed by community protests for service delivery on Wednesday (January 18).
On Thursday morning (January 19) it was back to normal with police monitoring the situation in the area and clearing some parts of the roads so that cars could move normally again.
Motorists are still advised to drive with caution when approaching the area to avoid damage to their cars.

Despite the fact that load-shedding was suspended on Friday January 20, parts of West Acres were without electricity for seven hours. It went off at about 01:37 this morning, January 21. One of the residents, Pippa Botha, said she had been informed by a City of Mbombela (CoM) call centre agent that they suspect there is cable theft in the area, but they are still investigating to determine if it is true. Botha said only some of the areas have had their electricity restored. Municipal workers are currently on the ground, but there is no estimated time for complete power restoration.

A man who bared his behind to an elderly resident on Saturday January 7 received a R10 000 fine for his antics, as well as a double dose of embarrassment when his actions were posted on a Marloth Park Facebook group. The man, who is from the North West, had allegedly been blasting loud music out of his bakkie in Seekoei Street, which is against the rules and regulations of the park. An elderly resident, who requested not to be named, said he had asked the man to turn the music down, as it could scare away the animals. However, the man instead climbed out of his vehicle and mooned the gentleman, who snapped a series of pictures of the incident. “I was quite surprised when the man mooned me,” said the resident. “I took a few photos and sent them to another resident in the area, Jan Koekemoer, who then posted them on the Marloth Park – Paradise on Earth Facebook group.” ALSO READ: Sections of White River without water for more than three weeks Koekemoer said the local community policing forum (CPF)was informed of the incident and a Nkomazi municipal law enforcement official went out in search of the man. The official, who asked not to be named as he is unauthorised to speak to the press, said the man was given a R10 000 fine. The official said the man was from the North West and had been travelling with a friend at the time of the incident. Marloth Park CPF’s Nadine Edgecombe said the man was also not allowed back to the area for the rest of the day and the following morning. She said he was allegedly very embarrassed when he discovered that his photo and bare bottom had been posted on the group. Efforts to track him down, proved unsuccessful by the time of going to press and this being posted.

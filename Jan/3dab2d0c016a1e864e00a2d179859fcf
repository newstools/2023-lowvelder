With many people expected to start travelling this week after the holidays, the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison has appealed to motorists to drive with greater caution amid high traffic volumes in the Lowveld. Those who are driving long distances are advised to rest as and when there is a need, if not every two hours or 200 kilometres. This will assist in improving concentration levels, better decision-making on the road and minimising some of the crashes caused by fatigue. It is important for motorists to also ascertain the roadworthiness of vehicles before the commencement of their journeys. Overloading will not be tolerated by law enforcement officers who remain on high alert for any violations by drivers.

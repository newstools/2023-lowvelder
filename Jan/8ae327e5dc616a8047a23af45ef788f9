During the first 17 days of 2023, 11 people drowned.

From April to December, a total of 82 people drowned in the province. The Mpumalanga Police Diving Unit is the entity working around the clock tending to these incidents. This includes going into hippo and crocodile infested waters. Despite the diving unit’s constant efforts, only 13 of the 14 December bodies were recovered. Captain Pottie Potgieter of the diving unit said 80% of the December drownings occurred when people tried to cross rivers with higher than normal levels, following the rain during that month.

January’s drownings, in turn, tended to happen when people went swimming because of the high temperatures experienced over the last few weeks. These occurred in eManzana, Elukwatini, Amsterdam, Marite, Tonga, Vosman, KwaMhlushwa, Embalenhle, Calcutta, Middelburg and Belfast. Potgieter said the warnings for avoiding drownings remain the same: Do not go swimming alone, do not cross rivers with a strong flow and do not go swimming while intoxicated.

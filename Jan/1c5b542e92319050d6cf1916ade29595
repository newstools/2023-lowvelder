The Limpopo police offer a reward of up to R50 000 for any valuable information that can lead up to the arrest and subsequent conviction of the suspects responsible for the murder of Phineas Matsepane. Matsepane was killed at home in Ditwebeleng Village. The 62-year-old man was shot and killed on April 18, 2020, by some unknown suspects during an alleged house robbery. “Four suspects carrying firearms forcibly entered the house through the dining room door, which was not locked,
and proceeded to the main bedroom. “They found a couple sleeping with their three-year-old child and ordered them to lie down on the ground, and then put blankets on top of them. The suspects demanded money from the man and threatened to burn the victims with an iron if they didn’t comply. They took the firearm belonging to the man, R31 000 in cash, two cellphones, two plasma TV sets and car keys,” said the Limpopo police’s spokesperson, Brigadier
Motlafelo Mojapelo. “The suspects took the wife outside the house while others remained behind with her husband. They shot the man, killing him instantly, before fleeing the scene in his vehicle, which was later recovered by the police after the
suspects had abandoned it in the nearby area.” The police opened a case of house robbery and murder and a manhunt was launched to track down the suspects.

The family of a Valencia man who was robbed of his cellphone at gunpoint yesterday afternoon, January 4, allegedly helped trap the suspects, leading to the arrest of two men. The man had been walking home for lunch in the Valencia area while talking to a family member on his cellphone, when three men in a silver Toyota stopped next to him. One of the suspects in the back allegedly jumped out of the vehicle and reportedly hit the victim in the eye with a firearm before grabbing the cellphone and jumping back in.

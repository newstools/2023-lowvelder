To reduce traffic congestion in Ga-Nkwana, Riba Cross, Praktiseer and other local areas,
the mayor of Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM), Cllr Eddie Maila, officially unveiled 21 recruits who will serve as pointsmen in various areas of the municipality.  They were introduced to the public on Christmas Eve in the FTLM’s chamber. Attendees included senior traffic officials as well as the FTLM’s management. “This programme is targeted at giving skills and experience to graduates, especially the youth,” said Maila. The chief traffic officer, Victor Lekwadu, said, “On a daily basis, the department receives complaints of bad driving and blatant disregard of traffic laws and rules. In order to restore law and order in our towns, we have systematically and continuously been enforcing traffic management.” He said the new recruits will assist with the free flow of traffic in the busy areas around the municipality. Maila encouraged them to take their work seriously and respect their seniors. Some of the new pointsmen can be seen directing traffic on the R37.

Mbombela and towns across the Lowveld celebrated the New Year with much bigger fireworks displays than in previous years, causing many animals to flee their homes and disappear into the night. Although the City of Mbombela opened certain parks and stadiums for New Year’s fireworks displays, many private homes ignored fire brigade by-laws and set off explosions late into the night.

We drove around all areas all night and this morning to find compromised and lost animals. Some animals are still lost. We are currently not aware of any serious injuries.” Pienaar said they found about 15 lost dogs, but were unable to catch them all. “We noticed lots of strays in Nelsville that ran away into adjacent properties as there are very few fenced-off ones there. “On behalf of all of us at the SPCA, thank you for all the assistance we received from the Fireworks Action Group (FAG). It really helped a lot. Together, we could take many animals to safety.” Hazyview resident Linda Smuts has five dogs. “My animals went crazy all night. Hazyview really went to town on fireworks this year. It was really bad.” Similar reports were received from Barberton, Sabie, White River and Mashishing. Zelda Stoltz of Mbombela said, “Thank you to the SPCA and FAG for your selfless efforts and for the time you took to keep the community’s animals safe.”

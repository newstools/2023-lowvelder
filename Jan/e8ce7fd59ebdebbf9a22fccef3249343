In the early hours of Tuesday January 3, more than 20 armed suspects reportedly stormed into a filling station in Graskop and held employees hostage before escaping with an undisclosed amount of cash. The provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela, has vowed that the police will work hard to arrest the suspects who were all wearing balaclavas at the time. The suspects initially posed as clients who wanted to refuel at around midnight. However, when fuel attendants offered their assistance, the suspects reportedly held them up at gunpoint and bound all of them with cable ties.

Later, the suspects allegedly detonated explosives to open the safe before fleeing the scene. It is furthermore alleged that a few minutes later, the suspects went to the tourist centre next to the filling station where they held a security guard at gunpoint and tied him with cable ties. The suspects somehow disabled the alarm system before accessing the building and allegedly detonated explosives to access the cash from the safe. They made off with an undisclosed amount.

Two holes left open in Robyn Street, Kingsview, Ext 2, are now posing a danger to the public and causing unnecessary traffic congestion for motorists. These holes were left open by some City of Mbombela (CoM) workers who had repaired burst pipes in early December. The residents of the house in front of which the holes are, said they have tried on several occasions to get the municipality to fill them, but nothing has been done yet. They said it is also hazardous for the children who walk there.

The motorists, on the other hand, may end up driving into the hole, damaging their vehicles and injuring themselves in the process. We are pleading with the municipality to come and close them before they cause harm,” they said. Several residents also said they do not know why the municipality is taking so long to close a ditch when it took them less than 30 minutes to open it to repair the pipe.

Now the community has to suffer, because there is a conflict between them. That is not acceptable, and I will push them until they repair it,” he said. The CoM’s spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, had not commented on any queries by the time of going to press.

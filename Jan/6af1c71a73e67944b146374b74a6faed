Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein is declaring an all-out war on drugs in the city and will be targeting both users and dealers in the area over the next few months. Gryvenstein said he has joined hands with various law enforcement agencies to ensure a clampdown on the scourge of drugs in the Lowveld, saying that narcotics in some circles of friends in the area are as easy to obtain as buying a shot from a bar. “It has come to my attention that illegal substances have become socially acceptable here, especially among people aged 30 and under,” he said. “Bossies will be working hand in hand with law enforcement authorities to track down and arrest users and dealers, and once they have been arrested and have appeared in court, they will be named and shamed socially.

A most concerning fact is that there are well-known individuals selling these drugs. I’m coming for all of them, no matter their connections,” he said. Gryvenstein added that methcathinone and cocaine were also being used and that marijuana sellers and users would be targeted. “Marijuana is legal to grow and use in the privacy of your home, however, if you operate outside what the country’s legislation stipulates, you will also be taken to task.” The security veteran said that in addition to having law enforcement work with him on the war on drugs, he also has his own team working on the operation. “Some of my team have received threats and will therefore not be named, however, this will not stop us from arresting you if you are found to be using and selling narcotics.” Gryvenstein said the operation would be ongoing for the next few months and added that funds would be needed to run sting operations.

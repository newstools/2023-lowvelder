The police have managed to clear the R40 between Acornhoek and Bushbuckridge after it was blocked by protesters this morning. January 17. They are demanding proper service delivery in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality (BLM). It has been said they will not stop protesting until the MEC for public works, roads and transport, Mandla Ndlovu, sorts out their road issues as the BLM mayor, Cllr Sylvia Nxumalo, has failed to resolve their problems. Apparently the community members had written to Nxumalo several times, but she never responded or addressed any of their complaints.

They also demand a tarred road as the current one is in a horrible condition. Due to the ongoing heavy rains, it is a hazard to drive on. Some of the area’s ward councillors have also been accused of failing to follow proper protocols when introducing new projects into their communities. Locals have threatened to continue blocking the R40 until their demands are met, even if the police disperse them, they promised to return and block a different location on the R40.

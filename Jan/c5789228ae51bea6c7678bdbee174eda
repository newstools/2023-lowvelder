We Care 4 Nelspruit started the new year on a high note by cleaning up several sections of Mbombela. Having received donations from concerned citizens, their hard work has been made easier. The organisation received a tractor with a slasher, dam scoops and scrapers, and a ride-on mower. Pr TJ Maré of the organisation said the donation will make a huge difference, especially in its day-to-day activities. “We always wanted a bigger slasher able to deal with bigger sections when we cut grass, since we have limited manpower. Even though it still needs to be repaired, it’s a big donation for us.” ALSO READ: We Care 4 Nelspruit cleans Mbombela parks He said they also secured a ride-on mower as the organisation only has one, which is not enough considering the amount of work that has to be done.
Maré said various businesses have come on board to assist in repairing the machine, and making sure that the tractor goes through testing for roadworthiness and getting proper documentation to avoid fines.

We are, however, still calling on other members of the community to donate anything we can use to keep cleaning our parks,” he said. We Care 4 Nelspruit had already cleaned Ferreira Street and several public parks throughout the city, and had cut the grass at these places. They are currently busy working on the areas around some of the bridges.

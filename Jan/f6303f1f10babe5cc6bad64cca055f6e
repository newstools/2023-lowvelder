The water supplier, Silulumanzi, released a statement earlier today, January 31, that load-shedding stages 5 and 6 have created serious challenges in the abstraction and distribution of water around some parts of Mbombela.  The statement said reservoirs are critically low and likely to empty out during these challenging times.  It said the Boschrand reservoir is experiencing a significant drop in levels, due to which a substantial portion of the following areas will be affected: Elawini, Drumrock, Ridgehill, the Disaster Management/Archive offices, Kiaat, Penryn and several areas up to White River.  “We urge customers and water users to please continue using water sparingly to avoid water reservoirs running empty during this critical period,” said the statement.  Silulumanzi has apologised for any inconvenience that the situation may cause, and has said it will keep the community informed of any updates.

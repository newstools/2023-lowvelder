She was collared three weeks ago, which has allowed us to track her movements using handheld VH telemetry. “At first, we thought she might have cubs, but it now appears she is alone. She came into Marloth three weeks ago, which is when we collared her. She crossed back into the Kruger, but subsequently returned to Marloth. Now she is stuck here because the river is so high.” Losaan van der Westhuizen of the Marloth Park Recreational Activities WhatsApp group said, “The lioness is constantly on the move and could be extremely dangerous. She could be anywhere at the moment and people should be very vigilant.” Comacho cautioned the public not to approach the lioness if she is seen. “Don’t let kids run around, especially not at night. People should not walk around Block A and rather stay close to their houses,” he said. If anyone sees lions in Marloth Park, contact Comacho on 082 353 9097 or Ernest Röhm on 083 626 6309.

The Apel SAPS has arrested two suspects after they had allegedly committed a business robbery in the village on
January 20. It is alleged that five suspects carrying firearms entered a tuck shop and robbed the owner of an undisclosed amount of cash. They fled the scene in a silver-grey VW Polo without registration plates. The police were alerted and a tactical snap operation was immediately conducted in the area. The suspects’ vehicle was spotted in Pelangwe Village, where one suspect was cornered and arrested. “The other suspects ran towards the mountain. The police officers conducted a search of that area and a second suspect was arrested after a shoot-out. The suspect was shot and wounded in the process. He was taken to a nearby hospital,” said the Limpopo SAPS spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafelo Mojapelo. The provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has welcomed the arrest. The SAPS said they might be linked to other serious and violent crimes. The two suspects, aged 29 and 41, are expected to appear in the Sekhukhune Magistrate’s Court soon, facing charges of business robbery, attempted murder and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. The search for the remaining suspects continues. Anyone with information is urged to contact the investigating officer, Captain Frans Mongwe, on 082 414 8030, or Crime Stop on 08600 10111, or the nearest police station.

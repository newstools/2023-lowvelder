Pr Johannes Ramashala said he received a lot of positive feedback after an article appeared in Steelburger/ Lydenburg News on December 8 last year.
The church needed help to finish construction, install electricity and build a bathroom.
Over the festive season, those updates were made and the new church in Skhila will officially be opened on Sunday January 29 at 10:00. UPDATE: Man shot at Mbombelaâ€™s Steiltes soccer ball confirmed dead Ramashala said this is an open service and that members of other church denominations are welcome to attend the service and celebrations afterwards.
In 1999, he started the Shalom Church Centre in Coromandel.
His prowess and dedication to faith and helping the community have made him a well-respected, humble and trusted leader in the community. The Shalom Church Centre has been approved to issue Section 18A certificates in terms of Section 18A of the Income Tax (Act 58 of 1962). This means that donations can be reclaimed for tax purposes.
There are still a few necessities needed at the church and the public is welcome to phone him.

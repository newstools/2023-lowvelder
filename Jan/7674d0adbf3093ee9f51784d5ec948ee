On Saturday January 21 the minister of forestry, fisheries and the environment, Barbara Creecy, paid a hospital visit to Joe Nkuna, the SANParks ranger who had been recently injured by an elephant in the Kruger National Park (KNP). Nkuna, a ranger with 32 years’ experience, was hospitalised on December 20, 2022 after being charged by an elephant while patrolling the Pretoriuskop section of the KNP. The severity of his injuries resulted in him being placed on life support in the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Johannesburg where he is making a steady recovery. The medical team is pleased with his progress and is excited that he will start physiotherapy soon.

I can say he is a remarkably brave man. He has endured multiple surgeries since the accident; but he has told me he cannot wait to get back to patrolling in the bush, doing the job he is very passionate about. Rangers are our heroes and face danger every time they go into the bush to perform their duties.”

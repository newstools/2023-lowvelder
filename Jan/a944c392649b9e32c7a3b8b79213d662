With less than a week left before the Sabie Tube Race, the organisers have one important thing to say: come and enjoy the day! Walter Serfontein, the head organiser, said they are excited and everything is ready for the rivergoers making their way to this picturesque town this weekend. As there are some safety tips to consider when going down a river, Captain Pottie Potgieter of the SAPS Mpumalanga Diving Unit gave some noteworthy tips for those embarking on this voyage. He and his team will be there during the race. ALSO READ: Youth Forum plants indigenous trees in White River Firstly, when people go down the river, they must try to do so with a friend. This way, there is someone who knows you went in, which means you must come back out at some stage. He advised people not to get cheap lilo-like tubes, but to rather opt for something sturdier. The rocks in the river will likely not treat your inflatable flamingo kindly. Sticking to the rock theme, the captain strongly recommended closed shoes, preferably takkies, to protect your feet.

• Do not panic, simply stand up. The river is shallow enough.
• If you are in trouble, shout for help. There are many people around who will hear you.
• If you are in a bit of a panic, the flow of the river will eventually take you to a slower part where you will be more in control.
• When you find yourself in trouble (for example with an injury), get out of the river. There are people to help and who will come and fetch you.

At 12:50 on January 1 at Mediclinic Nelspruit, Tsendo Tlou gave birth to a baby boy, Othalive Siphosethu Uyanda Dlamini. The healthy little one weighed 3.1kg at birth and is her first child. The exhausted mother, Tlou, said, “He arrived so quickly, and it all happened so fast. I am very happy.”
Her mom, Nomasantho Mnisi, was present and could not stop beaming. “I’m a first-time granny now,” she said. The baby’s father, Mphendulo Dlamini, was on his way from Johannesburg to meet his newborn son. Mediclinic’s second New Year’s baby, Mileah Engelbrecht, was born to Monica Scheepers and Hannes Engelbrecht at 09:15 on January 1. The baby was seven weeks premature and weighed 1.02kg at birth. She was still in ICU by midday on January 1, but in a stable condition. New mom Scheepers said she was feeling overwhelmed with joy and relief. “We didn’t expect the baby so soon, and there were complications, but everything is fine now.” ALSO READ: Forty babies born at Rob Ferreira on Christmas Day The baby’s proud father, Engelbrecht, said, “We just moved to Nelspruit three days ago, so this early arrival has been a huge surprise. I’m so relieved Monica and Mileah are alright.”  Mediclinic’s unit manager, Sr Yvonne Chuma, said the maternity unit is usually a very busy one, but it had been a fairly quiet night.
“We have another mother who is in surgery right now with the hospital’s third baby of the day,” she said.
Chuma wished all of Mpumalanga’s newborn babies a bright future.
“We look forward to seeing them grow up one day to be our leaders and future medical specialists. May God bless every single one of our New Year’s babies richly, and may they lead happy lives.”

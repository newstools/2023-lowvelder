One suspect (36) was arrested at Spring Valley in eMalahleni on Monday January 16 at around 18:00 in connection with the murder of Johan Nortjé. Nortjé was killed at about 06:30 on Sunday January 15 on his farm, Wilgekraal, in the Badfontein Valley. Members of the SAPD K9 Unit and other police department took part of the operation. The suspect was shot and wounded, and then arrested by the SAPS members. The suspect is currently in a critical condition at Witbank Hospital. The police members also managed to recover a white Toyota Hilux GD6, and a 9mm pistol and ammunition which were in the possession of the suspect. According to information, the vehicle and firearm were stolen during the farm attack. Nortjé went outside at 06:30 on Sunday morning to move his Toyota Hilux when he was approached by two suspects. According to an eyewitness, Nortjé was shot at point-blank range while his hands were in the air. The suspects tried to hide his body under large gingham bags in one of the outbuildings. The attackers then entered his home through the kitchen, assaulted and tied up Nortjé’s wife, Susan, with wire.
Farmworkers, already working in the fields, realised that something was amiss when they saw the Toyota Hilux driving at breakneck speed on the farm road toward the R36. One of the workers rushed to a neighbour with a tractor and the other workers rushed to the house. The neighbour untied Susan.
The Badfontein Landowners Association and neighbours alerted the Lydenburg SAPS of the attack.

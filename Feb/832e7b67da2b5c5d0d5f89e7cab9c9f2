The first Shalom Church Centre was founded in Coromandel by Pr Johannes Ramashala, other pastors, and the Coromandel community.
Part of the dedication ceremony was led by Bp Peter Seleti of the El-Rehobot Praise Church in Mokopane.
The ceremony was also attended by some Shalom Church Centre members of Coromandel. Willie Selepe represented the family of the late Sydney Press, who founded Coromandel. “Without the support of the Press family and the legacy that Sydney Press had left
behind, none of this would have been possible,” said Selepe.
Ramashala thanked everyone who had made the building possible with donations and advice.
“I want to thank Delane Maphanga,
Bp Peter Seleti, Angelinah Mamba, Fentse Seleti, Dr Lovemore Manaka (former rector of Pumelela Bible College), Pr Elizabeth Fenyane, Pr Lucas Mashegoane, Mavis Mashegoane, Pr Egbert Hiemstra, Francois Fuls and Nico Cross. This building process was organised and overseen by Manyepe Masotla,” said Ramashala.

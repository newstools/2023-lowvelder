A foreign tourist can count his lucky stars that a Kruger National Park (KNP) team was able to rescue him on February 10. The KNP confirmed that although there have been no injuries or fatalities as yet due to the heavy rainfall, there was an incident in which a tourist’s vehicle got stuck in the water at one of the bridges near Lower Sabie. “He was rescued just in time,” said Isaac Phaahla, the spokesperson for SANParks.

As a precautionary measure, the teams have closed gravel roads in the south and flagged camps (Talamati, Lower Sabie, Crocodile Bridge and Biyamiti) since the fall of heavy rains on the evening of February 8. “Meanwhile, emergency teams are also closely monitoring the situation in the northern part of the park as rivers have also started rising in various parts of Limpopo.”

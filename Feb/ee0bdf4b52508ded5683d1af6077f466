Fifteen suspects were arrested by the Limpopo Hawks on Friday February 10 in connection with South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) fraud. A ward councillor and a medical doctor were among the suspects who were arrested in Jane Furse, Steelpoort.
“The councillor allegedly recruited community members who do not have a disability, and in cohesion with the doctor obtained disability grants for them. The doctor allegedly certified the community members as disabled for their applications to be approved,” said Matimba Maluleke, Limpopo Hawks spokesperson. Maluleke said their investigations revealed that the suspects shared funds from the disability grants once Sassa officials had processed the payments.
Maluleke said they received a tip-off from Sassa officials about the alleged scheme. The Limpopo Hawks launched a sting operation that led to a series of arrests. More arrests are imminent.
The suspects will appear at the Polokwane Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday March 1.

Pediatric Care Africa (PCA) will depart from White River Square on Sunday February 12 for its fourth Ride for a Child motorcycle charity event. The ride will see PCA’s founder, Dr André Hattingh, travel 7 000km around the country, visiting the most northern, southern, eastern and western points in South Africa accessible by motorcycle. Hattingh said the purpose of the charity motorcycle ride is to generate funds for the organisation’s campaign, #HELPMYOP, a bid to raise money for surgeries for children whose parents cannot afford their urgent medical treatment. He said that in some cases, the kids do not have parents or legal guardians to pay for their much-needed surgeries.

He will be accompanied by a support vehicle that will depart from Pick n Pay in White River Square at 09:00. The team will return on March 4 at 13:00. PCA was founded in 2017 and to date has handed out the equivalent of over two million meals, and over 5 000 baby packs containing baby milk, food and nappies. The organisation has also assisted almost 6 000 people with free medical treatment and helped just over 1 000 children receive visits to specialists and private doctors. Hattingh and his team are appealing to both the public and companies to sponsor R1 for every kilometre he completes. You can find out more on the organisation’s website, www.pediatriccareafrica.org.

An Ehlanzeni District intelligence task team pounced on an alleged human trafficker on Monday February 27. Information was gathered and followed-up by the members, which led them to a house in KaMagugu outside Mbombela. Local security company, Divergent Ops, also formed part of the operation. The members found 19 Bangladeshi males in a three-bedroomed house. They further found that their cell phones were placed in one plastic bag, which suggested they had no way to communicate with either their relatives or friends.

The 18th edition of the Van Wettens Nite Race took place on Friday, January 27, with the runners going off in the sunset. This year, 500 runners reported at the starting line at Kwanyoni Lodge for the 4.5km and 10km races. According to Monica van Wetten-Fourie, the marketing and brand manager of Van Wettens, the majority of the entries were for the 4.5km fun run. “It is always our most popular run distance at the race,” she said.

It is the first official race on the running calendar each year, and always attracts the public wanting to start the new year off on a positive note. “We had quite the number of New Year resolutions runners at the starting line, everyone eager to burn some December calories,” Van Wetten-Fourie said. Although the weather plays a big role in the outcome of the event, Friday had the perfect running conditions.
This was only the second year Kwanyoni Lodge had played host to the race, but with the positive feedback, the organisers are receiving, the aim is to continue holding it there.

Everyone always compliments us on the beautiful route and the safe location,” Van Wetten-Fourie said.
She would like to thank their partners, 3% Properties, for coming aboard this year again to host a most successful race.

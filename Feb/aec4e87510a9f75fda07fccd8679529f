Some residents still get filthy, smelly water, which raises concerns about health hazards. They claim they buy drinking water even though the regular supply has improved.

A source close to the water treatment facility alleged that the City of Mbombela (CoM) is not using the right products to test the quality of water, and that it is not even checking it regularly like it is supposed to.

“The people responsible to test the quality of water at one of the water plants supplying the area are using a swimming pool tester,” said the source.
They also claimed that the filthy water from the taps is due to the constant burst asbestos pipes, and the fact that the water is not purified properly. Once again, CoM’s spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, was unavailable for comment after several phone calls and text messages.

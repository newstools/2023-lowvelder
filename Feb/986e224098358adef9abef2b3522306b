City of Mbombela workers are currently working to switch on traffic lights at the intersection of Dr Enos Mabuza and Johanna drives.
According to a ward councillor, Thea Rix, the Department of Technical Services has started working on the road to ensure the lights are operational again after having been off for some time. “We are hoping that this time they will finish working on it and make sure that they are working again as residents have been complaining and demanding that the municipality repair it after the upgrade of Enos Mabuza for quite some time.

In December the City of Mbombela’s spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, said the municipality would have the traffic lights operational within a month. They have not been functional since the beginning of the upgrade on Enos Mabuza, although the road is already 90% done.

The city manager is engaging with leadership to find a solution to this challenge. We hope that both the traffic and street lights will be energised within a month,” he said at the time.
Ngala was unavailable to give an update regarding the lights’ progress at the time of going to press.

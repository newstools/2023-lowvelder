“Despite our dams being at satisfactory levels, most areas are still experiencing water supply challenges which are aggravated by load-shedding. Therefore, extreme caution by water users is still critical to ensure sustainable water supply in the country,” she said.
Mavasa also advised people to avoid going near dams or rivers for their own safety. • The figures of Driekoppies, Longmere and Primkop were not available at time of publishing.

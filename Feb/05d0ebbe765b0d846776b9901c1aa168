According to a two-week rain outlook by SAWX, a South African weather company, published on their website on Wednesday, Mbombela and surrounds can expect up to 200mm or more until February 16. The sky is predicted to start clearing up the week thereafter. In the meantime, Storm Report SA, another weather company in the country, advised residents to stay indoors and off the roads, and to avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where the water rises above the ankles. “Never drive on a road covered by water. You do not know how deep it is or if the road has been washed away,” it said. Lowvelder will continue to update its readers accordingly.

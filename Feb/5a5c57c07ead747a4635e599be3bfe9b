The Kruger National Park’s (KNP) disaster management teams remain on alert as the park continues to receive more rain on February 16. “We appeal for patience and co-operation from tour operators, tourists and drivers within the KNP during this period to minimise any risk to human life and infrastructure. “We are trying our level best to open passage for visitors to continue enjoying the park during this rainy period. Gravel roads in the south of the park remain closed for now and are being monitored constantly. They will be opened as soon as they are deemed safe,” said Oscar Mthimkhulu, KNP managing executive.

• The Crocodile River remains in high flow, with sustained flows from upstream, but not excessive flood conditions. But the rest camp is still not admitting overnight visitors as yet and the gate is for emergency access to replenish supplies and fuel.
• The Sabie River remains in high flow with sustained flows from upstream. Access to Lower Sabie is expected to remain closed for the next 48 hours.
• The Olifants River remains in high flow. Lepelle Northern Water used the flood conditions as an opportunity to flush the Phalaborwa Barrage, creating important storage capacity for future dry conditions.
• Access to the north of KNP remains open over the high-water bridges over the Sabie and Olifants rivers, although the Balule low-water bridge remains closed and will remain for the foreseeable future.
• The Letaba River remains in high flow although only intermittent rain is expected. There is no access at the low-water bridge connection between Phalaborwa and Mopani Rest Camp. High-water bridge access to the far north is unaffected.
• The Shingwedzi River remains in normal summer flow conditions.
• The Luvuvhu River also remains in normal summer flow, as does the Limpopo River in the far north. Access to Makuleke Contractual National Park/Pafuri Section remains open. Importantly, during this flood period SANParks remains in constant communication with the Department of Water and Sanitation and catchment management agencies, as well as its neighbouring water management authorities in Mozambique and the provincial disaster management centres in South Africa.
• Overall conditions from a river ecosystems perspective is that the flood conditions provide good natural flushing conditions for the rivers and groundwater recharge, which is important for dry season flows. At this stage there is are no concerns from a conservation perspective.
• All gravel and management roads in the southern KNP, however, sustained significant damage which will only be assessed over the next 14 days as conditions start drying out and technical staff members are able to get to these roads.

There are some forecasts for further wet conditions in 10 days or so, however, the park relies on the official impact-based rainfall forecasts generated by the South African Weather Services for forward planning. These new impact-based forecasts have really assisted SANParks to be proactive and pre-emptive in its planning. Where road access is concerned, this is the current situation: All dirt roads in the south (Marula Region) remain closed, as are a minority in the north (Nxanetseni), due to wet conditions. The majority of tar roads in the park remain fully accessible, except in the south with no access from Skukuza to Lower Sabie due to washing away of the road at three locations. ALSO READ: WATCH: Lowveld National Botanical Garden closed to the public due to storm damage There was some damage to other smaller bridges, but these have been assessed for safety and remain open. “We strongly urge our visitors to remain vigilant and under no circumstances access roads where barricades have been placed. There have unfortunately been a few occasions where tour operators in open safari vehicles have removed the barricades which might endanger the lives of their clients. In summary:
• All tar roads in the park are open, except the main road between Skukuza and Lower Sabie.
• The Pretoriuskop to Skukuza main road remains closed.
• Talamati and Biyamiti bush camps are closed.
• Balule is now open. Access from the south, S89 and S90 is possible. The Olifants River low-water bridge is still closed.
• Sable Hide is closed.
• Shimuwini, Bateleur and Sirheni bush camps are open.
• All rest camps are operational except Crocodile Bridge and Lower Sabie.
• All entrance gates except Crocodile Bridge are open.
• The restrooms at Tshokwane are currently out of order.
• Skukuza Airport is operating, but advises passengers to contact their lodges to get information before flying to Skukuza. The airport is currently processing passengers to and from the airport via Shelati Bridge. All transfer companies, lodge representatives, and car hire should pick up and drop off people in the Skukuza Day Visitors Site which is adjacent to the train/bridge, because the Sabie low-level bridge is currently flooded. The park’s management is grateful for the co-operation of both staff and visitors during this period as no lives have been lost. It implored visitors to be extra cautions when approaching low-lying bridges. The technical team is currently monitoring all infrastructure and carrying out repairs where possible. A full assessment of the damage caused will be done once the water has subsided.

Social media and other platforms have been inundated with images and videos of river levels and overflooded bridges in the Kruger National Park since the early hours of February 9. SANParks spokesperson Ike Phaahla told Lowvelder that the park had received heavy rain overnight. Some low-lying bridges have been flooded, but Phaahla said the situation remains manageable as teams on the ground work to reopen certain roads covered with debris. Access to Skukuza from the Paul Kruger Gate was blocked earlier, for example, but has been reopened thanks to the technical team on the ground. As far as access into the park goes, he said all gates aside from the one at Crocodile Bridge are accessible.

The road between Lower Sabie and Skukuza is not accessible via the low-water bridge, as a part of it has washed away, but Phaahla said travel via the high-water bridge is still possible. As yet, there have been no other reports of damage to infrastructure. For guests reconsidering their trips due to these weather conditions, Phaahla’s advise was to rather postpone than cancel if they decided against a trip right now. As the situation is ever-changing, he said guests can keep monitoring the park’s social media pages. Updates on the state of roads are posted as they are received from the ground.

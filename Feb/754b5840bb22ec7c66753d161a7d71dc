The community of Violet Bank near Dwarsloop barricaded the R40 in the early hours of this morning, February 7. They demanded clean and consistent household water, the lack of which has been a problem for a while. They insist that the Bushbuckridge Local Municipality (BLM) rectify the issue. The protesters allege they informed the BLM before the protest that something had to be done to rectify the situation. The police managed to disperse the protesters and clear the road to allow traffic flow after a while. Several motorists have been complaining about the ongoing protests on the R40 since the beginning of this year. They say communities along the road are simply using it as an easy way to voice their complaints, instead of taking their problems to the relevant municipal offices. The protesters are seen as taking advantage of this road in the heart of an economic area and these motorists demand constant visible policing on this route, especially in the hotspot where the protests usually occur. The Atherseat and Matsikitsane communities recently blocked the same road for more than two weeks, demanding improved roads and a supply of water. They promised that they would not stop protesting until the relevant MEC addressed them. Since then, more communities have joined in the protests, which affects motorists who are forced to use longer, alternative roads to reach their destinations. The BLM spokesperson, Fhumulani Thovhakale, said they are aware that the R40 was closed in at least four different areas today. “We do not have any information regarding the reasons for the road closure in the other areas, as it is done in the middle of the night. There are no protesters on-site from whom one can get clarity on what their grievances are,” Thovhakale said. She also condemns the ongoing closure of the R40.

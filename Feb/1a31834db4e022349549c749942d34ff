On Wednesday February 15, 392 people put on their running and walking shoes and took on the Power of Love Night Race at Mbombela Stadium, not only in attempt to shake off the previous day’s Valentine’s chocolates, but also to support a good cause. Yolanda Odendaal started the race with Nelspruit Marathon Club in 2016 when she was the club’s chairperson. “The idea and goal behind the race were to generate funds for community projects, so that the runners can give back,” Odendaal said. She is the chairperson of Run/Walk for Life Nelspruit. 2023 was the first year Run/Walk for Life hosted this event.

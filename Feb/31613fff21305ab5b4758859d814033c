A 61-year-old eSwatinian national is expected to appear in the Nkomazi Magistrate’s Court tomorrow, February 17, after he was found in possession of almost R30 000’s worth of compressed dagga.  According to a statement by a provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, the man was reportedly travelling in a taxi from Magudu to Malalane when the Tonga police stopped it and searched all the passengers.  The officers opened a bag and found three black plastic bags containing compressed dagga with an estimated street value of about R28 000.

He was arrested for dealing in dagga and for contravention of the Immigration Act after it was discovered he was not in possession of the necessary legal documents allowing him to be in the country.  Mohlala said the investigators are working in collaboration with the Department of Home Affairs on this matter.

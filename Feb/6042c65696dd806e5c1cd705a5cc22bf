According to a warning (valid until February 26 at 23:00) issued by the South African Weather Service (Saws), Overland Depression Freddy is not expected to significantly affect Mpumalanga. The Saws said earlier rainfall forecasts are no longer valid. Lighter rainfall is expected at this stage, with minor impact still possible. ALSO READ: Some gravel roads in Kruger closed The impact may include localised flooding of susceptible informal settlements, low-lying roads and low-lying bridges. Poor driving conditions due to pooling of water on roads and reduced visibility are also possible. Closure of low-lying roads, increased travel times and difficult driving conditions on dirt roads are among the other issues to consider when travelling.

The N4’s eastbound slow lane between Schagen and Alkmaar is closed due to a load of steel fencing having fallen off the back of a truck this morning. TRAC’s Solange Soares said the TRAC help desk received a call this morning at 06:46 that the load had fallen into the eastbound lane, which has been closed for the recovery and clearing process. She said the eastbound fast lane is still open. It is unclear how long the recovery will take, however, Lowvelder will keep its readers updated on the situation.

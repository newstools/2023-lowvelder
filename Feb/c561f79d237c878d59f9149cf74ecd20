At Langdraai, close to Kwena Dam, freight and agriculture-related vehicles could be seen for kilometres on Wednesday.
The long-distance haulers and the farming community are currently driving on the verges of the road as the tarred area is cordoned off due roadworks. Due to the heavy rain and mud, the heavy vehicles are struggling to move forward. The Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, managing the construction, is urging roadusers to take alternative routes or make use of the N4 toll route.

The building site at Laerskool Laeveld was officially handed over to the new contractors, Impisi General Construction, earlier today, February 2. Before this occasion, the site had been left dormant since December. According to the spokesperson for the Department of Public Works, Bongani Dhlamini, the previous contractor was terminated due to slow construction pace and poor-quality work, and so the process was halted. Representatives of Impisi, including the project manager and civil engineer, visited their new site on the day of the handover. They said they hope to resume construction as soon as possible and are already planning the way forward.

The resumption of the SAB Safa League in Sekhukhune saw two teams chasing for promotion lock horns at Montrose Soccer Ground in Driekop lastÂ  Saturday. Hosts Royal Pirates welcomed MJ United FC from Moroke at the fully packed stadium. The visitors controlled the early proceedings of the match, but lack of firepower in front saw them miss clear-cut opportunities. The Royal Pirates recovered from the early onslaught and started creating chances of their own. They were rewarded with a penalty on the stroke of half-time, but the host team failed to convert their spot kick.
MJ United introduced lanky striker Khutjo Mohuba in the 60th minute. He gave the Pirates problems at the back. In the 83rd minute. Mohuba capitalised on lapse of concentration by the Pirates defenders. He beat an offside trap and converted a low shot to give his team a lead. MJ United defended well to protect their lead and to win the match 1-0. The win sees MJ United top the SAB
Safa League.

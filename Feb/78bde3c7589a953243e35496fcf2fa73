The Mpumalanga Division of the High Court has sentenced convicted ex-cop Mugiyo Ulrich Mabunda today, February 17, to life imprisonment for the premeditated murder of his wife, Tebogo. Mugiyo shot and killed his wife outside their house in Stonehenge in May 2020. He turned the gun on himself and shot himself four times. He was convicted in June 2022, and his most recent appearance in the high court was on December 5. Judge Cassim Moosa said the court wanted to pass judgment, however, they had to postpone it to today, as they wanted both the defence and state to be present.

Search-and-rescue parties looking for a missing Marloth Park resident have been asked to stand down as of midday today, February 2, as he was found dead. The man, Nicolaas Jacobus Hauman (62), was reported missing on February 1 after he had reportedly been involved in a motor vehicle accident in the area at about 05:30. It was reported that he had last been seen by an eyewitness to the accident, and it is believed that he had sustained a head injury during the crash. It is thought he might have left the crash scene on foot to find help. Just before 12:00 today, searchers were asked to stand down and stop looking for Hauman. It is believed he had died as a result of the injuries he had sustained in the accident. Hauman’s daughter, Nicole, confirmed her father’s passing in a Facebook post. “It is with extreme sadness and great sorrow to let friends know that my dad was found, and has passed away. We are all in deep shock! Please pray for us all. He was taken too soon! Our hearts are broken!” This is a developing story. Lowvelder will update its readers once more information becomes available.

Ledwaba is the chairperson of the Mashishing Civic Coalition.
He is a regular guest on SABC News, News Afrika and several national radio stations, commenting on political issues.
One of his main activism goals is to fight alleged corruption in the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality.
Outa said Ledwaba was honoured due to his fearless and no-nonsense approach to political issues in his communities. “His municipality is falling apart and he is not accepting it. He combats corruption on a daily basis by voicing his discontent. Despite death threats, he has the communities’ best interest at heart. We would like to take this opportunity to thank him for exercising the courage that he did
in taking a stand, despite the many negative consequences and hardships that so often
transpire under such circumstances,” said Wayne Duvenhage, Outa’s CEO. Duvenhage said active citizens like Ledwaba makes a significant difference in the fight against maladministration, corruption, unethical conduct, and the abuse of power, which has plagued the country for far too long. The intention of Outa’s moral courage recognition programme is simply to pay
homage to courageous actions, he said. The nomination was evaluated and approved by Outa’s moral courage recognition evaluation committee.

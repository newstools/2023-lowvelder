Pediatric Care Africa’s Dr André Hattingh is on day 15 of his Ride for a Child charity motorcycle event, his fourth one, and has called it the most challenging trip when compared to previous rides. The ride is taking Hattingh 7 000km around the country to the most northern, southern, eastern and western points of South Africa.
The trip is to help generate funds to assist 45 children with surgeries and 400 children with visits to private specialist doctors this year, under the campaign #HelpMyOp. Hattingh left White River Square on February 12 in the pouring rain for his epic journey around the country. “Our biggest challenge the first four days was the continuous rain, making it the wettest ride in memory,” he said.

Hattingh has already reached the most northern point of the journey, the Beitbridge Border Post to Zimbabwe, and Alexander Bay, the most western point. Cape Agulhas, the most southern point, and St Lucia, near the most eastern point, still remain. Hattingh said he had a lot of time to think during his ride, and one thought has kept on repeating itself: how lucky and fortunate he is to make even the slightest difference in a child’s life. “Children don’t need or ask for rubies and gold, but they only ask for a little love and a chance,” he said.

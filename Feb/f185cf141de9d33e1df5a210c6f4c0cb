Various parts of the Kruger National Park (KNP) are expected to receive more rain in this coming week, February 13 to 17. This has led to the park’s management temporarily closing some of the remote camps and evacuating staff members to nearer, safer camps until the situation improves. “As a precautionary measure, gravel roads and remote camps have been temporarily closed, including those used to evacuate guests from Lower Sabie, Biyamiti and Crocodile Bridge out of the park yesterday, February 12,” said the KNP’s managing executive, Oscar Mthimkhulu.

A disaster management team is in motion and periodical updates will be released until the situation improves,” he said. He further reported that tar roads are open, although the teams had to temporarily close some of them (the route between Pretoriuskop and Skukuza, as well as the one between Malelane and Skukuza) yesterday for a short while, for guests’ safety. These were reopened as soon as the flash floods had stopped.

The airport is currently processing passengers to and from the airport via Shelati Bridge. All transfer companies, lodge representatives, and car hires should pick up and drop off guests at the Skukuza Day Visitors site, which is adjacent to the train/bridge. This arrangement was put into place, because the Sabie low-level bridge is currently flooded.

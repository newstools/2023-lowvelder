An evacuation operation is under way in the Kruger National Park (KNP) to assist guests, who were staying at Lower Sabie, Talamati, Crocodile Bridge and Biyamiti camps, with available safe passage out of the KNP. This is due to the heavy and continuous rainfall that the park has experienced since February 8. The KNP said this is an evacuation route, and no visitors will be able to travel through to those camps. Guests with bookings at the affected ones are advised to amend their dates through the Central Reservations number, 012 428 9111.

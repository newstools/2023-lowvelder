According to yet another warning by the South African Weather Service (SAWS) issued this morning, February 13, a tropical wave will continue to enhance widespread showers and thundershowers over the Lowveld and escarpment areas of Mpumalanga. The service issued orange level 9 and 5 warnings for significant to severe impact.

The escarpment and Lowveld regions of Mpumalanga have borne the brunt of the flooding, with the southern half of the Kruger National Park particularly affected. Many low-water bridges and causeways, including the Crocodile Bridge and the causeway at Lower Sabie, are flooded, while numerous main roads, including the main road linking Skukuza to Lower Sabie, are closed due to flood damage.

The weather company SAWX predicts more rainfall for the majority of Mpumalanga throughout the coming week, although not as much as the area had seen in the past week. A two-week rainfall outlook indicates that residents’ rain meters will capture less rain as we near the end of the month, but measurements of up to approximately 60mm can still be expected.

However, scattered to widespread showers and thunderstorms are still expected for the remainder of the week for a large portion of the country. Lowvelders are asked to be careful when driving, as the roads are wet and further damage remains a high possibility.

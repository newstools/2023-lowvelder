Local fans of the popular South African musician Loufi flocked to Mabalel Lodge to watch the Afrikaans rapper’s live performance on Saturday, January 28. Joined by his drummer, Rhuwaal de Lange, the duo had the crowd up and dancing as soon as the show started. Singing crowd favourites like “Baas vannie plaas”, “Boude”, “Wit Skoene” and “Liquorman”, fans danced and sang the night away.

The South African Weather Service (SAWS) issued a warning for severe thunderstorms in places over the Highveld and along the escarpment of Mpumalanga on Wednesday morning, February 1. The warning remains valid for February 2 from 18:00, and stretches into the evening until about 23:00. ALSO READ: Mpumalanga dam levels remain at almost full capacity Due to slow-moving thunderstorms moving in from the coast, heavy downpours of rain and gusty winds are expected. According to SAWS, these weather conditions may result in localised flooding of roads and neighbourhoods in some areas, as well as reducing visibility when driving, increasing motorists’ travel time. Mbombela residents can expect the rainy conditions to continue through until next week, although the chances of rain decrease nearer to Sunday. Remember to pack in your umbrellas, turn on your car’s headlights and plan ahead before you travel.

The management of Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) changed its suits for overalls on January 13 to launch the Action Friday campaign. It is geared towards involving senior management members of TCLM to be actively involved in service delivery. They participated in the patching of potholes, cutting of grass and trees and clearing of illegal dumping sites, to name but a few. According to Peter Mankga, the acting municipal manager, the campaign is aimed to vastly improve service delivery. “The aim is to achieve a meaningful impact that is aligned with the core functions and mandate of the municipality. The TCLM management has further declared 2023 as the year of service delivery, which will see a concerted interface of the various directorates’ programmes in the endeavour to achieve the municipality’s key deliverables and mandate,” said Mankga. The programme was extended to Sabie, Graskop and the northern areas.

Xenophobic violence flared up in Burgersfort Ext 10 on Wednesday morning as rioters petrol-bombed several shacks in the area, mostly inhabited by foreign nationals, and sex workers. Since last week, taxi operators had been chasing nyaope addicts from the Burgersfort CBD, claiming they were allegedly robbing commuters and shoppers. The taxi men are also allegedly chasing sex workers and drug dealers. They insisted they are destroying the town and its good image. On Wednesday, the operators attacked sex workers and several illegal foreigners who allegedly sold drugs to locals in the CBD. The Burgersfort SAPS are currently on the scene, monitoring the area. A few foreign nationals were seen driving away from the area. The sex workers have fled the town while others are homeless. This is a developing story. Updates will be shared online.

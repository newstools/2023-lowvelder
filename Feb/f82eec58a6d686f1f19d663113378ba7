The Mpumalanga Disaster Management Unit has reported unstable road conditions following heavy downpours across the province. More rain is expected this evening and tomorrow morning, February 11. The unit has urged those travelling to and around Mpumalanga and the Kruger National Park to take heed, and urged motorists and pedestrians not to cross bridges where the road surface cannot be seen.

Disaster Management also urged visitors to the province to call their accommodation ahead of their arrival to find out if guests are still being received and if certain routes leading to the establishment are closed or not. TRAC’s Solange Soares said, however, that the N4 remains open.  Lowveld residents have been posting photographs, videos and updates on various WhatsApp groups and social media, including warnings that a large piece of road along the R40, about 500m from the Swartfontein turn-off past the Klipkoppie Dam, had broken off. Fallen rocks in the road between White River and Sabie have also been reported. There have also been reports of an earthquake outside Marloth Park yesterday, February 9. Disaster Management said it was aware of the reports and that the incident will form part of a later assessment, as human life is the unit’s priority.

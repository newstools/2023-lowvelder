Residents of De Kom (Ga-Komane) are pleading with the Fetakgomo Tubatse Local Municipality (FTLM) to assist them with an access road leading to their village that is situated in the mountainous areas of Leolo. The villagers alleged that in 2019, FTLM spent a whopping R11m on the maintenance of rural roads and
upgrades, but they are still without proper roads. They alleged shoddy work was provided by the contractors. “It’s a nightmare during the rainy seasons, our vehicles cannot even reach our homes. During funerals the
cars struggle to move. We still use donkeys to ferry groceries in order to reach our homes, it’s hectic,” alleged
one of the villages.
“We feel like the FTLM has neglected us, it’s been more than 25 years in a democratic country, but we still suffer without basic needs,” said a community member. According to the residents, the municipal contractors only gravelled the road and left the site in 2019. “The contractor left without even placing tar on the road. We are not only without roads; access to clean
water is also a major challenge. We plead with local mines surrounding us, and the FTLM to fix these
problems, so that we have a better life,” they said. This publication forwarded queries to the FTLM’s communications department, but at the time of going
to press, they were yet to respond.

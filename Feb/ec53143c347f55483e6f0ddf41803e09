With more heavy rainfall expected across South Africa, traffic authorities are warning motorists to exercise caution on local roads. Tubatse has seen some localised flooding this morning, February 12, with some rivers overflowing, which is preventing motorists from crossing. Road users in Burgersfort have been urged to be cautious as some parts of the Steelpoort River (Tubatse) on the R37 are overflowing following the heavy rain. Motorists are advised to use alternative routes.

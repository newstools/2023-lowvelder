The R38 at Verulam in Barberton is now open following an hour-long road closure by some community members in the area. The Barberton SAPS spokesperson, Constable Prayer Mbungela, said the road had initially been closed last night, February 13, at about 21:30 when some members of the Sinqobile community in Verulam stopped and looted a truck transporting vegetables. Mbungela said while the situation was resolved and the road had been cleared last night, it was again closed this morning at about 10:30 when some residents of Sinqobile blocked the R38 and stopped a truck driver on the road. The members are said to have taken the driverâ€™s keys and used the truck to block the road.

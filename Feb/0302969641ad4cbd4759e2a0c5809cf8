In the early hours of Monday February 20 about ten suspects attempted to steal money by bombing the Sasol filling station in Hazyview.
Their mission failed because they were unable to open the cash safe, which was also too heavy for them to carry.
One of the employees was seriously injured and is currently being treated at Matikwane Hospital.

When he refused they detonated two charges on the door of the room the safe was housed in, blowing it open. The gang could not open the actual safe door. They then tried to carry the safe but it was too heavy for them and they then decided to abandon it and flee the scene in three vehicles,” they said.

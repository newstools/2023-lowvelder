In what SANParks called a bittersweet victory, some Kruger National Park (KNP) rangers came across suspected poachers on February 12, when the park was experiencing large-scale floods. “To say that the past few days have been hectic for the KNP management and its teams, is an understatement,” the park said. The rangers were not exempt from playing vital roles in managing the floods, however, they did not lose sight of their key responsibility – conserving nature at all cost and fighting the ongoing scourge of rhino poaching.

Their search revealed two suspected poachers hidden under the tarpaulin with a bag containing supplies and poaching equipment. “A suspected hunting rifle was revealed by forensic experts upon their arrival and a thorough search of the vehicle. The three suspects were detained and handed over to the Skukuza Police Station.” The park said this was commendable work, and criminals must be aware that security is still tight despite the weather conditions. “Ranger Services are on high alert, helping guests and safeguarding our rhinos.”

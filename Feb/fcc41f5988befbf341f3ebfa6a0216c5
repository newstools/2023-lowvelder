The South African Council for Business Women (SACBW) Nelspruit recently held its first networking event for 2023 at Southern Sun Emnotweni. The businesswomen and members of SACBW Nelspruit support one another’s businesses as much as possible to help each one grow. The speakers for this event were Sakhi Lubisi and Nozipho Masuku of Assupol and Estelle Roe of Junxion Communications.  Roe shared information on SWOT analysis and how it works. The purpose of this was to help the members get to understand how they can aim to evaluate and create opportunities for their businesses.

I think it is important to reassess where you are every year. Sometimes you need to get out of your business so that you can look at it.”  Lubisi is a sales representative at Assupol. She did a presentation on opportunity and things people refer to as important. “Let’s use every opportunity we get, every little chance you have to network with people. We all define ‘important’ differently. For example, if I had to have an opportunity to have a lot of money, I would invest my money, as this what I have learnt. Others can choose to pay off debts.” ALSO READ: KNP set to welcome the Palace Orchestra After the demonstrations and presentations, they all started networking and enjoyed a breakfast together.

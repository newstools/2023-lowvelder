They stopped a taxi operator at the traffic lights, narrated to him what they had observed, and requested him to assist in investigating. As they went to the man, the bag fell down from his trolley. It was opened by one of these concerned citizens, and they were surprised to find the body of a female inside. “The Barberton SAPS was immediately called, however, when they arrived, some community members had already started assaulting the man. The police managed to calm the situation down and the suspect was rescued from the angry mob. He was arrested and taken to hospital to receive treatment under police guard,” said Mohlala. According to him, the motive and cause of death have yet to be established, and a post-mortem will be conducted.

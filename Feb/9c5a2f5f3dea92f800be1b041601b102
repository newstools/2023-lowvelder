The section under construction will be from the intersection of Voortrekker and Barac streets (Spaar-O-Rama four-way stop) to the De Beer Street intersection at Nedbank and Standard Bank. The refurbishment programme started on Tuesday and the estimated duration is four months. “The municipality has appointed MartMol Trading as the construction company. A traffic management plan has been submitted for consideration and was approved by the council. This does not include the building of a crossing over the railway line. Out of the four available lanes, two will be closed in the initial construction phase and the other two lanes will be open to traffic from opposing directions,” said Themba Sibiya, Thaba Chweu Local Municipality’s (TCLM) spokesperson. Sibiya said ward councillors and the contractor’s safety officer will provide regular updates and communication regarding traffic management.
The businesses affected by the refurbishment and the residents will also be kept up to date through several media platforms.
TCLM started the project in September 2021.
Phase one included the section of Voortrekker Street from The Heads to Spaar-O-Rama. It was scheduled to be finished by January 2022, but was delayed until April.
The second phase included Potgieter, Church and Viljoen streets, also known as the De Beer Street project. The completion date for this was estimated to be May 2022, but it was only completed by the end of September last year. TCLM appealed to motorists and members of the public to be patient and exercise caution during the construction period.

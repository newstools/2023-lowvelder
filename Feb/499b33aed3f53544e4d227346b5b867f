Residents continue to suffer from the decaying state of the water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in constant shortages, dirty water and continuous sewer leakages.
According to some locals, they had been buying drinking water due to the lack of water in the area, and the poor quality of what little water is supplied. Load-shedding is one of the problems, but the ageing infrastructure remains a cause, too. One resident, David de Bruyn (65), said the situation in the area is getting worse, especially for those who cannot afford to buy water, because the people must pay for water services and then buy water anyway in order to survive.

As a pensioner I cannot afford to buy water, which I have a right to have. When I eventually have water in my house, it is not drinkable, because it is dirty and has a bad smell.” Virginia Mlobela (63), another resident, said it is now a nightmare. “Now we have endless sewage spillages into our house, which is a health hazard. The constant leaks in the pipes are causing a water shortage and we can’t do anything without it. It is about time that the so-called caring government starts to care.” ALSO READ:  Gaping holes left by municipal workers pose serious danger in White River Deon van Schalkwyk (57) said he is relocating because of the situation he is in.

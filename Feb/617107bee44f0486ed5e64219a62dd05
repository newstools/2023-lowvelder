The Lowveld National Botanical Garden has been closed to the public following massive storm damage and flooded areas in the garden itself. Lowvelder spoke with the gardenâ€™s interpretation officer, Lou-Nita le Roux Joubert, who said the decision to close the garden until further notice was taken by management on Sunday February 12. She said she had been working at the garden for almost two decades and had never seen such severe damage or high water levels following almost a week of heavy downpours in the Lowveld.

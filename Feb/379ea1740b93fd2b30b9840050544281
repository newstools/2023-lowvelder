The South African Weather Service (SAWS) issued a yellow level 2 warning this afternoon, February 16, for disruptive rain in the Lowveld. The possibility for rain is high, however, minor impact is predicted. The weather warning is valid from 08:00 tomorrow, February 17, until 23:00. Tropical air mass and the horizontal movement of water vapor are expected to cause rainfall in areas that are already affected by flooding, such as Ehlanzeni. Due to the soil already being saturated, and rivers and catchment systems already being full after the previous rains, localised flooding is possible.

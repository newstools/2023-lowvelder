A weekly report on dam levels issued by the Department of Water and Sanitation has shown an improvement in Limpopo water levels from last week’s 87.1% to 91.1% this week. During a similar period last year, the province’s overall storage capacity stood at 88.5%. This improvement, due to  the recent heavy rains, means that the available water in the province as of this week is at 1 348m³ out of a full capacity of 1 480.1m³. The Polokwane Water Supply System, with dams supplying water to Polokwane and surrounding areas, is currently at 106.9%, an increase from last week’s 104.6%. Last year this time the system had stood at 102.7%.
Middle-Letaba Dam and Mokolo Dam remained unchanged at 0.7% and 101.2% respectively. Vondo Dam also experienced no movement this week and is standing at 101.5%. Despite the overall improvement, Doorndraai Dam decreased from 99.1% last week to 98.7% this week. Nzhelele Dam improved from 98.7% to 104.1% this week and De Hoop Dam improved slightly from 101.3% to 102.9%. Flag Boshielo also managed to also go up slightly from 107% to 108.5%. The department warned communities in low-lying areas to be cautious, as most of the dams are full. The department further reiterated its call on citizens to continue using water sparingly, and to also refrain from vandalising water infrastructure in their areas.

With Tropical Cyclone Freddy expected to make landfall in Madagascar on Tuesday, February 21, the South African Weather Services (SAWS) said it is highly unlikely to have any major impact on South Africa. As of this morning, February 19, SAWS said that Freddy has strengthened overnight to a very intense tropical cyclone category, equivalent to a category 5 hurricane. It has been predicted that the cyclone will make its first landfall in Madagascar on Tuesday, February 21, and is then expected to re-enter the Mozambican Channel, where it is expected to rejuvenate its energy and progress towards the Mozambican coastline.

In its current projected path, Freddy is highly unlikely to have any major impact on South Africa,” said SAWS. SAWS forecaster Lehlohonolo Thobela told Lowvelder that the system is expected to bring light showers east of Limpopo on Friday, but that it will not directly affect the province with its position. “It will supply moisture that will assist in the development of light showers and rain over the eastern parts of Limpopo on Friday,” he said. As Freddy has been classified as an intense tropical cyclone, its current wind speeds are between 166 to 213km/h. SAWS has said it will continue to closely monitor the system, and that regular updates will be provided.

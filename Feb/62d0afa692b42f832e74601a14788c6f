Fortunately, no SAPS member sustained injuries.” He said the injured suspect could not produce a firearm licence and was arrested for attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm. An ambulance was called to the scene and the man is currently in hospital under police guard. Further investigation will be conducted to determine whether the firearm was used in other criminal activities. The suspect is expected to appear in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court soon. At the time of posting, it was unclear what had happened to the second suspect.

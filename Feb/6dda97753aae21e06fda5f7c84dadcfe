Regarding reception issues within the park, management said it has noted that many guests have been struggling to get through to central reservations, and sometimes the camps, to alter their bookings. “Please note that central reservations has been inundated with calls since the floods began. Some camps have had their data and phone lines damaged from the rains. If you struggle to get through, alternatively, please contact our satellite offices for assistance. Shingwedzi is also currently unavailable due to damaged communication lines. Your patience is still much appreciated during this difficult time.”

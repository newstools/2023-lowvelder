The provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela, said she welcomed the life sentence that was handed down to convicted ex-cop, Mugiyo Ulrich Mabunda, who shot and killed his wife during a domestic dispute in 2020. He was sentenced by the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court in Mbombela on Friday February 17. Manamela said, “The precious life of Tebogo Mabunda was cut shot at the age of 39. She was a professional quantity surveyor and an employee at Mpumalanga Disaster Management before sadly shot and killed by her husband on May 14, 2020 at their home Stonehenge.

Later he fatally shot her then shot and wounded himself. Police as well as the medical personnel were summoned and she was unfortunately certified dead by the paramedics at the scene, the Mugiyo was taken to hospital under police guard. Tebogo left behind her three children.” Manamela said the accused was taken to court after his recovery where the state presented a strong case against him, hence he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.
During his conviction by Judge Cassim Moosa in June 2022, which happened while he was absent, the court cancelled his bail and ordered the accused to submit himself to the authorities.

We continue to urge men to refrain from using violence to resolve domestic issues. What remains as a pain is that the three children were the greatest losers at the end,” explained Manamela.

The R536 between Hazyview and Sabie has been permanently closed due to the collapse of a section of road about 20km outside Hazyview. The road first started collapsing on February 14 due to the ongoing downpours. By Sunday February 19, a much larger portion of the road had gone. The road has been closed from both the Hazyview and Sabie sides with chevron boards and further sets of “closed” signs have been placed 500m from the collapse. Reports are that the whole road is very dangerous and that further collapse could happen at any time.

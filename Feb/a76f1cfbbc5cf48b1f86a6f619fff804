We Care 4 Nelspruit unblocked the storm water drains in Ferreira Street just before the heavy rains started.
According to the founder of We Care 4 Nelspruit, Pr TJ Maré, they realised that the rainfall and the state of the drains could result in the road flooding.
Maré said they had been cleaning the pavement and bush in the Elmadré area when they noticed most of the storm water drains were blocked.

After we cleaned them, we revisited them during the rainy week and saw the existing system had been
well built, but not maintained,” he said.

Our plan is to work with them for the benefit of our town,” he said.
The CoM spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, said the municipality will check which procedure We Care 4 Nelspruit used to approach it, before he could comment.

South Africa’s long-standing premier river race, the Dusi Canoe Marathon, had lots of differences this year, and surely won’t be one that’s easily forgotten. This year’s race, which took place between February 16 and 18, didn’t start in Pietermaritzburg, and it didn’t even start near a river. Instead, it started on a polo field at the Bishopstowe Country Club with a 3km run down to the Msunduzi River.

There was huge excitement and nerves at the start of day 2, as after 45 minutes of paddling and running, the Dusi hits the flooded Umgeni, and rumours were rife of the huge water conditions. The Umgeni did not disappoint, with huge wave trains and holes to navigate. Three extra compulsory safety portages were instituted, but everyone enjoyed an amazing day on the big water. The local racers of the Lowveld Canoe Club (LCC) who participated in the marathon, included Kelly Tar, Craig Lewis, Clive Brown and Mike Adams.

An intelligence-driven operation by a task team of Crime Intelligence led to a 24-year-old man being arrested on allegations of hijacking. The suspect was apprehended in Masoyi on March 9 at 11:55. A provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, said the team members approached a certain tavern in Mahushu in Masoyi, where information was obtained regarding the whereabouts of a suspect believed to be involved in truck hijacking around the area. “While carrying out the operation, the suspect was cornered and the police searched his vehicle. They found a firearm with ammunition for which he failed to produce the licence. “He was arrested and the vehicle was confiscated for further investigation. The firearm will undergo ballistic testing to determine whether it was used in other crimes,” Mohlala said. He said preliminary investigations also revealed that the suspect was involved in other criminal activities, so a charge of robbery with a firearm was added. The suspect will also face a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm with ammunition. “The police cannot rule out the possibility of adding more charges against him as the investigation continues. He will appear in the KaBokweni Magistrate’s Court on Monday, March 13, facing the said charges,” said Mohlala.

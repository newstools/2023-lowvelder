Maputle Secondary School in Ga-Maroga faces a challenge of overcrowding in its classes.
The school has more than 1 500 pupils, but only 14 classrooms.  Stanley Eliezer, the project’s co-ordinator, said to remedy these challenges, they introduced the Maputle Bottles for Bricks Initiative on February 14, which will run until the end of March. “With this, we will collect more than 100 000 soft drink bottles and sell them to local stores. The money generated will be used to buy bricks. We request members of the community, business people and any other relevant persons to assist us in this project.” Keabetswe Maimela, a Grade 11 pupil of the school, confirmed they have already collected more than 15 000 bottles. “We will be happy if our dream can be realised. We will continue with this initiative and ensure new classrooms are built for our school. We once again plead with locals to keep on donating these bottles to our school.” Maputle’s excellent matric results in the past three years have consistently been above 95%. It is among the best schools in the Driekop Circuit.

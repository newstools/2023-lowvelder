The chairperson of the Mashishing Civic Coalition (MCC), Pompies Ledwaba, laid the criminal charges.
After the cases were opened in Lydenburg, Outa (Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse) helped expedite the Mpumalanga Hawks in Mbombela’s investigation and it was elevated to the national Hawks commissioner, General Godfried Lebeya.
On Thursday February 23, Hawks vehicles arrived at the TCLM’s town hall. The search for evidence pertaining to the investigation lasted two days. The Hawks confiscated boxes full of files and documents.
Last Wednesday, the Hawks returned to Lydenburg and confiscated laptops and more files. Captain Dineo Segotodi, spokesperson for the Hawks, confirmed to Steelburger/Lydenburg News that she was aware of the investigation.
“It is in the critical early stages and still under investigation. We are refraining from issuing a statement, because the investigation team is still compiling possible evidence from the documents and laptops that were confiscated,” said Segotodi. “The MCC will not be able to rest until those who are allegedly stealing public money give it back or sit in jail for their wrongdoing. This is not a threat, but a promise. We must all stand together and get justice for everyone, not just people living in a specific area of town,” said Ledwaba.
Segotodi said the confiscation of the documents was only the beginning of an investigation that may take a few months.
More information will be made available after the Hawks hand their findings over to a state prosecutor.
The TCLM’s communication office said it would need more concrete facts before responding to the allegations.

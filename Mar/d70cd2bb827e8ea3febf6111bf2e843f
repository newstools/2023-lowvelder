The City of Mbombela (CoM) has appointed Delight Sibanyoni as its new chief financial officer (CFO) during a special council sitting on Tuesday. All opposition parties opposed her appointment, as they said they believe she did not qualify for the position, and that the correct procedures were not adhered to during her appointment. Sibanyoni joined the CoM in 2009 as senior manager of financial planning and budgets, before being appointed as acting CFO last August. Before joining the CoM, she worked for the Mkhondo Local Municipality’s finance department.

“On behalf of the CoM, I would like to welcome you on board. I believe you will take the municipality to greater heights. We will give you the support we provided when you were acting in the position, and we hope we will get a clean audit from the Auditor-General under your leadership,” said Makushe-Mazibuko.

It needs someone who will come up with workable plans on how to help pay the Eskom bills and other critical services. The EFF will, however, continue to monitor the situation and the new CFO’s performance,” Sedibe said.

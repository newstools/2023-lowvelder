The Nelspruit Rugby Club was filled with motorcycle club members from all over on February 25. The Crusadersâ€™ Banished Charter had its third birthday dayjol here with live music, a beer tent, games and food available throughout the day.  Sergeant-at-arms Hennie Badenhorst of the charter said the dayjol served as a fundraiser for both the club and the Nelspruit SPCA. The event was child-friendly and also had three bands keeping the crowd entertained.   At the end of the day, various prizes were handed out for titles ranging from most standard and most customised bike to the biggest Crusaders charter, and, of course, the coveted title of Miss Banished.

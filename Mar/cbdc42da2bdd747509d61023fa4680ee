Seven people died in a motor vehicle accident next to Maranata Lodge on the D1399 on Sunday.
It is suspected that a Volkswagen hatchback was involved in a sideswipe collision with a Toyota Avanza. Both drivers lost control of their vehicles, which overturned and caught fire. Seven people, including the drivers, were burnt beyond recognition. The only survivor was transported to Philadelphia Hospital for treatment of serious injuries. Law enforcement officers on the scene said reckless driving was a possible cause of the crash. The Limpopo MEC for transport and community safety, Florence Radzilani, sent condolences to the bereaved families. “We are saddened by the news and send heartfelt sympathies to those who have lost their loved ones in this tragic incident. May they be granted the strength to get through this difficult time. We also pray for the speedy recovery of the surviving passenger. “The loss of lives on our roads due to reckless behaviour by some motorists is a cause for concern.
“We urge all drivers to be mindful of their actions at all times, for everyone to arrive alive at their respective destinations,” she said.

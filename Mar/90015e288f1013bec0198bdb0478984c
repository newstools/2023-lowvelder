Fed up with the lack of services, the residents of Phaahla and neighbouring villages blocked the Apel Cross with burning tyres and debris on Monday and Tuesday mornings. The people demanded access to clean water, electricity and tar roads. They were adamant they wanted to be addressed by the mayor of Makhuduthamaga Local Municipality (MLM), Minah Bahula, and the Sekhukhune District Municipality’s executive mayor, Maleke Mokganyetji. The public order policing was called to monitor the situation.
“We understand the communities can have their own grievances with the authorities, but blockading roads is never a solution. They need to address their demands with the relevant authorities,” said a SAPS members at the scene. At around 09:00 on Tuesday, the situation was calmer after SAPS had removed some of the debris from the road, but it remained impassable. “The authorities are undermining us, there is lack of service delivery in our villages. We vote for the ruling party but when it’s time to deliver, they are nowhere to be seen,” alleged one of the protesters The residents say they are always promised water before the elections, but the promises are never fulfilled. “Since the era of Nelson Mandela, we have been told we will get water. It’s painful that we still rely on rain to access water and also share river water with our livestock.” “Mokganyetji and several executive committees members from MLM are currently locked in talks with protest leaders at the Masemola High School to come up with a workable solution and to draft a way forward. We are cautioning road users to be vigilant when approaching the area as the road remains impassable,” said the MLM spokesperson, Lemson Morapyane.

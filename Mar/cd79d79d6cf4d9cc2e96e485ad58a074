The construction in De Clerq Street has been delayed by rain.
According to the DA ward councillor, Marius Opperman, the construction is in partnership with Booysendal Platinum Mine and the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality.
The contractor is Obee Family Holdings and the civil consultants are Sadecon Africa Consulting, Structural and Electrical Engineers.
The total refurbishment process started in October last year. It is a six-month project and the completion is scheduled for May. On Wednesday February 22 about 23% of the work was completed, which is a little behind schedule due to the recent rain.
“This is a total refurbishment of the road that includes the replacement of storm water pipes, water pipes and all other municipal assets embedded in the road.
“Even sleeves are inserted for future electrical cables and fibre to be installed without digging up the road again. We would like to thank all stakeholders and business owners affected and inconvenienced for their patience and co-operation for the duration of the project,” said Opperman.

I want to congratulate the teachers for their work and the roles they played. Let’s continue to compete with ourselves so that we can become excellent. Today we are here to appreciate the work we did to reach our set a target, although we did not reach it. Our target was not to be number one. We had identified schools that can reach 100% and we had a target for bachelors passes, for the most improved schools, top 10 and more. We had hoped that we would get the vehicle for the best matriculant in our district again.” Brukwe said the district is going to try to do things differently next time. She said they need to appreciate the primary schoolteachers for the foundation they laid.
She thanked all the sponsors who supported the district.

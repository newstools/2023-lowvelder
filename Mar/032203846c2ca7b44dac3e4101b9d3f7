Next year, 30 years after the first democratic elections, South Africans will go to the polls again.But this time there will be no banners, no songs of joy and freedom and no wild expectations.The elections of 2024 will be a bitter fight against the powers of corruption and destruction. It will be a crusade to avenge the killing of a dream.
According to analysts, the road to 2024 will be marred by violent protests, vigilantism, political murders, and more darkness due to Eskom’s woes.
Even the other side of 2024 will be a volatile one, as it is expected that the ANC will gather not much more than 40% of the votes. This will change the political landscape drastically, and a volatile period is expected by some analysts. All this will be a special challenge to business owners. Many want to know where to position themselves for the time to come.
To answer this question, we have gathered some of the country’s most influential voices to help business owners think how to engage with the future. Helen Zille, politician, André Duvenhage, political analyst, and Stefanie Fick of Outa will form a panel at Church Unlimited on March 28 to help business owners plan their strategies.
The event will start with a finger breakfast at 09:00. The panel discussion will start at 10:00, after which guests can ask the panel members questions. The panel discussion will be led by Izak du Plessis of the online news channel, Nuuspod.
Unfortunately, André de Ruyter will not be able to attend the event any more, as he is currently abroad after the dramatic events at Eskom, when he blew the whistle on alleged corrupt activities at
the power supplier.

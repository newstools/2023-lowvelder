Two siblings, Arshandi Zitha (34) and Peter Zitha (30), were sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment on poaching-related charges in the Skukuza Regional Court yesterday, March 2. A provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, said three suspects, including the Zitha brothers, had entered the Kingfisher Section of the Kruger National Park (KNP) on July 18 last year.  He said field rangers who had been patrolling the KNP that day suspected there were intruders and summoned a helicopter to help trace the suspects. The Zitha brothers were discovered, but the third suspect disappeared without a trace. The siblings were found in possession of a hunting rifle without a licence, three live rounds of ammunition, three bags, a knife and an axe. The Skukuza police were called and the men were arrested. It was then discovered that the duo are from Mozambique and in South Africa without valid documentation. They had also entered the park without permits.

He said count six, which is one year’s imprisonment, will run on its own. The brothers will therefore effectively be behind bars for 11 years. He added that the two were further declared unfit to possess a firearm in terms of Section 103 of the Firearm Control Act.

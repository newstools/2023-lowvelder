Mpumalanga rapper Costa Titch collapsed and died while performing at the Ultra Music Festival at the Expo Centre in Johannesburg on Saturday, March 11. One of his fans shared a video of him collapsing while performing on-stage. The cause of death is not yet confirmed; however, it is suspected that he had a seizure possibly triggered by the flashing lights. Costa Titch, real name Costa Tsobanoglou, was born and raised in Mpumalanga, and was a learner of Penryn College. He reportedly had a history of epilepsy, a condition that affects the brain and causes seizures. He was well known for his dance moves and had gained popularity with his single, ‘Big Flexa’, for which he had received over 45 million views on YouTube. Earlier this year, he received a major co-sign from Senegalese-American musician Akon. They would be teaming up for the ‘Big Flexa’ remix, whose visuals have already surpassed a million views on YouTube. His family was unavailable for comment at the moment.

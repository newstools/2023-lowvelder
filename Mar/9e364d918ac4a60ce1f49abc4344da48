The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) has warned that there may be possible crocodile activity around the Vygeboom Dam area, and has urged people to be careful and remain on high alert when around dams or rivers in the province. The MTPA wildlife unit’s Ertjies Röhm said a large crocodile was reported to have been spotted at a river near Vygeboom Dam in early February. He said the MTPA had set up a cage to catch it, however the recent floods had washed it away before the croc was caught. Röhm said these reptiles have been known to roam the area and urged the public to be wary of them in general. ALSO READ: Elderly victim of White River robbery in hospital

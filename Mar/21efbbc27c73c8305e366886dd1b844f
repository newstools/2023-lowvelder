A meeting was held in Hoërskool Bergvlam’s hall on Tuesday night, March 7, to begin the process of establishing the Nelspruit Residents and Ratepayers Association. Convened by Pr TJ Maré, who is also the founder of We Care 4 Nelspruit, the meeting was well supported by community members from Ward 12 and 14 to 18 in Mbombela. Maré emphasised that the association would not be a political party, but would be a way for residents and ratepayers of Mbombela to make their voices heard in matters such as water and electricity issues and student accommodation complaints, to name a few.

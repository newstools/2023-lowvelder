According to Johannes Mkhabela, the MCW’s spokesperson, the initiative’s aim is to reduce the rampant crime in the area and to encourage the community to participate in fighting it. “Following many concerns from citizens about crime such as cable theft, housebreakings, gender-based violence and robbery, we decided it was time we do something about crime. We launched the MCW in August to assist the police to fight crime. The MCW consists of 10 members, six men and four women, who work tirelessly to make sure the streets of Mashishing are safe. We wish to have more people join. “The steering committee is Veliswa Ndlovu (chief organiser), Zama Ngwane (treasurer), Mapitsi Tshitangano (secretary), Busi Sengwayo (deputy secretary), Thabang Nkomo (organiser), myself (spokesperson), Eric Masilela (deputy chairperson), Thapelo Mokoena (organiser) and Jan Nkosi (chairperson). “We are working closely with the community policing forum, Sun Security and the local police. We don’t have an office, but we are hoping the old police station in Mashishing can be fixed and have a working telephone line for those people who don’t have social media,” said Mkhabela. He said it was important for the community and businesses to take a stand against crime. “Currently, we need training for our patrons, whistles, reflective vests, and petrol to patrol the streets. At the end of the month, we go to town and conduct patrols, because we are aware of card scammers. Tackling crime in our community requires everyone to get involved, and an active MCW with good working relationships is still the first line of defence against crime in any area.” To join or support the MCW, call Mkhabela on 073 977 3510 or Ndlovu on 076 372 6664.

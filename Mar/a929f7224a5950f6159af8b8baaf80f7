Buy Local Lowveld, a small non-profit initiative dedicated to promoting and supporting local businesses, held its first event of the year at the Barnyard at the Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre on Friday February 24. It was a great success and was made possible by the generous support of the local community and giveaway donors, including Fountains Farms, Gin & Co, Slowveld, Sabie Valley Coffee, Keen on Quinoa, and Buy Local itself.

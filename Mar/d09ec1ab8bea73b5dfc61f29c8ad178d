In the early hours of Monday March 15 at 01:15, two people in Ext 2 Mashishing, narrowly escaped with their lives after their shack went up in flames. The cause of the structural fire has not been determined and is being investigated by the Lydenburg SAPS.
The bed, fridge, closets, and television were destroyed. The residents of the shack were apparently asleep when they realised a fire had broken out. The Thaba Chweu Emergency Services assisted on the scene and prevented the fire from spreading and consuming other buildings on the property.
The two injured people were treated on the scene, but did not have to go to hospital.

The MEC for the Limpopo Provincial Treasury, Seaparo Sekoati, tabled the Limpopo budget 2023 last Tuesday.
He indicated that the provincial government continues to be persistent in its investment in infrastructure. Sekoati tabled the 2023/224 provincial budget at the Limpopo Legislature in Lebowakgomo. As he allocated budgets to various departments, Sekoati said, “Considerable progress has been made in the forward planning and delivery of infrastructure. In addition to that, our provincial infrastructure expenditure and delivery performance reports for the 2022/23 financial year can attest to this”.
The Limpopo Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure received a budget allocation of R4.9bn for 2023/24, R4.4 billion for 2024/25 and R4.5 billion for the 2025/26 financial year. The allocation also includes R1.8bn for conditional grants, part of which will be allocated to the Roads Agency Limpopo (RAL) as part of the agency’s allocation of R2bn for roads maintenance, upgrading, partnerships and other operational costs.

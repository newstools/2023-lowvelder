They hoped the baby was safe in his father’s custody and started to conduct their own search. As dawn broke, there was no sign of the child’s return, so they finally reported the matter to the Schoemansdal SAPS,” said Mohlala. He said the police immediately launched a manhunt. “Our members received information that the child’s body was found dumped in the bushes a few metres from the water reservoir and a diesel depot in Middelplaas. The child was found wrapped with a bloody blanket and a towel, his throat cut open.” ALSO READ:  Response officer injured in Rocky Drift filling station robbery Mohlala said the investigation was intensified, and information was received that the suspect, the child’s father, was at his uncle’s place in KaMaqhekeza, where he had arrived with a bag full of clothes. “The Schoemansdal police did not waste time and followed up this lead.
